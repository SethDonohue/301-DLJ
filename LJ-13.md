### 301 Daily Learning Journal - Day 11

## What I learned
- Heroku setup, running and general concepts
- Branch management, develop, production
- Development, Staging, and Production Environments

## DEMO
-

## What was Frustrating
- The last days have been pretty frustrating because we have had some big errors that no one can seem to help on or direct us in the right direction.
- Why is our code working locally but breaking when pushed to gh-pages?
- It's been very difficult to learn the new material when the old stuff isn't working at all.

## Group Stuff
- Rob and I are getting better at dealing with the issues, but bing a day behind makes it hard to focus and learn.

## Extras?


### Project Ideas

- I am working with some friends on project ideas for 301/401 and already want to work on them, but don't have the freetime after class and my brain is usually fried by the time 7pm rolls around :P, but here are the items I am thinking over:

1. Rotating Globe that shows click able pins/locations for a travel blog that can link to a blog article, a picture album, or maybe just basic destination info and or tourist attractions for that location.


2. Customer Database on a google map with all the customer information...
-use getJSON or something similar for this customer database.

3. Application / Chrome Add-on that informs electronics consumers where, how, and what of they're product is built, and where the product they're replacing goes when they are done with it. The database for the information on each project would be difficult to find, but general information could be used for starters.
- I think I'll have to definitely use the getJSON or something similar for this database idea...

4. A galaxy map of all the planets Keplar has discovered... and all the other known planets.... I posted an idea on the group discussion for application ideas. It's much more well defined.

Depending on the databases available I think it'd be fun to do a galactic map of all the known exo-planets that have been discovered ( It's about 5000 now) and map them with a relative position and angle with respect to our solar system in our local neighborhood of our galaxy ( The Milky Way!)

The Model would be public database(s) that have all the information for each exo-planet that has been discovered, and where it is in relation to our sun/solar system.
The user could choose which type of exo-planets they want to see (earth-like, gas-giants, in the habitable zones) and could even add other databases with other objects (Dwarf stars, black-holes, red-giants, etc...)


API's for:
- Getting data from the server/database,
- Drawing and manipulating graphics
- Manipulating the DOM
- A Galaxy map API?

Stretch goal, you could have it automatically make an illustration of that planet based on available info, i.e an educated guess on what it might look like.

This stretch goal would make it a killer app and NASA would definitely be interested.
I think this isn't as difficult as it sounds because the data is out there, we just have to figure out how to put it onto a map... I bet there is an API map similar to google maps but use the galaxy as the actual map image.
