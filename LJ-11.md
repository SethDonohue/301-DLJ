### Project Ideas

- I am working with some friends on project ideas for 301/401 and already want to work on them, but don't have the freetime after class and my brain is usually fried by the time 7pm rolls around :P, but here are the items I am thinking over:

1. Rotating Globe that shows click able pins/locations for a travel blog that can link to a blog article, a picture album, or maybe just basic destination info and or tourist attractions for that location.


2. Customer Database on a google map with all the customer information...
-use getJSON or something similar for this customer database.

3. Application / Chrome Add-on that informs electronics consumers where, how, and what of they're product is built, and where the product they're replacing goes when they are done with it. The database for the information on each project would be difficult to find, but general information could be used for starters.
- I think I'll have to definitely use the getJSON or something similar for this database idea...

4. A galaxy map of all the planets Keplar has discovered... and all the other known planets....
