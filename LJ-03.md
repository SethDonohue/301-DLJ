### 301 Daily Learning Journal - Day 03

## What I learned
- Learned a ton more about jQuery and how to actually use it. Got fairly comfortable with some of the methods. Also refreshed in constructors and prototypes which was useful to further understand each of them.

## What was Frustrating
- Nothing was really frustrating today in Lab, it was one of the rare days when we smashed it out.

## Group Stuff
- Dustin knows what he is doing and is very easy to work with! Today went really well and we finished in a few hours with little stress.

## Extras?
- Did some more Codewars on my own today and it was much more helpful in getting me some extra practice in coming up with solutions from scratch.
- I am working with some friends on project ideas for 301/401 and already want to work on them, but don't have the freetime after class and my brain is usually fried by the time 7pm rolls around :P, but here are the items I am thinking over:

1. Rotating Globe that shows click able pins/locations for a travel blog that can link to a blog article, a picture album, or maybe just basic destination info and or tourist attractions for that location.

2. Customer Database on a google map with all the customer information...

3. Application / Chrome Add-on that informs electronics consumers where, how, and what of they're product is built, and where the product they're replacing goes when they are done with it. The database for the information on each project would be difficult to find, but general information could be used for starters.
