### 301 Daily Learning Journal - Project Week - Day 18

## What I learned
- Spent a fair amount of time today with .thens and learned how to properly format them to get them to truly work as a .thens. You need to make it an anonymous function inside of the .then vs just doing a callback only.
- Also learned some stuff about specificity in CSS, but need to learn more about it... it's still fuzzy

## What was Frustrating
- Just CSS confusion

## Extras?
