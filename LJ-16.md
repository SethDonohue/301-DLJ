### 301 Daily Learning Journal - Project Week - Day 16

## What I learned
- I learned that it's easy to over complicate things especially based on limited experience with server setup. We didn't realize until half way through the morning yesterday that we only needed to have a client side for our MVP. Once we reach MVP we'll add a server side to make our own historical database and keep track of player stats over time.
- We got fairly far with our goals for the day yesterday and today we'll most likely finish the build to logical MVP, and then finish up the looks.

## What was Frustrating
- Not much once we realized we were overcomplicating things...

## Extras?
