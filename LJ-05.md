### 301 Daily Learning Journal - Day 05

## What I learned
- Learned a ton more about forms today and the code review was very useful as usual. The code demo today was fast, and intense, but should help put things together this weekend.
-
## What was Frustrating
- Lab went well today, which gave many of us a much needed break. I even got to take a short nap! Codewars has been great too in getting new skills up to speed and practice practice practice.

## Group Stuff
-

## Extras?
(Same as before, I plan to keep this extras list consistent and build on these ideas with the knowledge i learn each week.)
- I am working with some friends on project ideas for 301/401 and already want to work on them, but don't have the freetime after class and my brain is usually fried by the time 7pm rolls around :P, but here are the items I am thinking over:

1. Rotating Globe that shows click able pins/locations for a travel blog that can link to a blog article, a picture album, or maybe just basic destination info and or tourist attractions for that location.

2. Customer Database on a google map with all the customer information...

3. Application / Chrome Add-on that informs electronics consumers where, how, and what of they're product is built, and where the product they're replacing goes when they are done with it. The database for the information on each project would be difficult to find, but general information could be used for starters.
