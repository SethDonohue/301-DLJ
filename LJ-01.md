### 301 Daily Learning Journal - Day 01

## What I learned
- The basics on true pseudocoding, which i will be improving upon greatly I hope. This will be my most needed tool as that previous class didn't have enough planning to it.

## What was Frustrating
- SMACCS... I'm sure it will become more clear with time and Tuesdays lab, but it is not at all clear even after todays lecture.

## Group Stuff
-Kerry is great to work with! we get along and planning is strong most of the time with us. Pseudocoding was well thought out and easy for both of us.

## Extras?
